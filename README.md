solution to sorting_algorithms exercises


0. Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) algorithm

	Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
	Youâ€™re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements
	Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

		in the best case
		in the average case
		in the worst case
